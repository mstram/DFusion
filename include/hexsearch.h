// The here[] array, starting at 1, is filled with the locations of the

// Also, the target[] array, starting at 1, is filled with the target
// 		addresses of all CALL, JMP, JZ, JNZ, and JCC tokens.

// Okay, I admit this one is complicated.  Treat it as a black box.

// Search Dwarf Fortress's code and initialized data segments for a pattern.
//		(Does not search stack, heap, or thread-local memory.)
//
// Parameters: any number of search tokens, all unsigned ints.
//		The last token must be EOL.
//
// 			0x00 - 0xFF: Match this byte.
// 			EOL: End-of-list.  The match succeeds when this token is reached.
// 			ANYBYTE: Match any byte.
// 			DWORD_: Followed by a dword.  Exact-match the dword.
// 				Equivalent to 4 match-this-byte tokens.
// 			ANYDWORD: Match any dword.  Equivalant to 4 ANYBYTEs.
// 			HERE: Put the current address into the here[] array.
// 			SKIP_UP_TO, nn: Allow up to nn bytes between the previous match
// 				and the next match.  The next token must be a match-this-byte
// 				token.  There is sweet, sweet backtracking.
// 			EITHER: Accept either of the next two tokens as a match.
// 				Both must be match-this-byte tokens.
// 			RANGE_LO, nn: Set low byte for a range comparison.  DEPRECATED.
// 			RANGE_HI, nn: Set high byte for a range comparison, and do the
// 			comparison.  Should immediately follow a RANGE_LO.  DEPRECATED.
// 			BYTERANGE, nn, mm: followed by two bytes, the low and high limits
// 			of the range.  This is the new way to do ranges.
// 			DWORDRANGE, nnnnnnnn, mmmmmmmm: works like BYTERANGE.
// 			ADDRESS: Accept any legal address in the program's text.
// 				DOES NOT accept pointers into heap space and such.
//			CALL: Match a near call instruction to a reasonable address.
//			JUMP: Match a short or near unconditional jump to a reasonable
//				address.
//			JZ: Match a short or long jz (jump if zero) instruction.
//			JNZ: Match a short or long jnz (jump if not zero) instruction.
//			JCC: Match any short or long conditional jump instruction.
//			More tokens can easily be added.
//
// Returns the offset in Dwarf Fortress of the first match of the pattern.
//		Also sets global variables here[] and target[].
